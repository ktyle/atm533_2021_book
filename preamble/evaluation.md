Up to 24 hours late: 10 % penalty
24-48 hours late: 20 % penalty
48-120 hours late: 50 % penalty
More than 120 hours late: 100 % penalty
<br>Since assignments will typically be submitted electronically, each file will automatically have a timestamp, to avoid any questions of the time that the student completed the homework. The instructor reserves the right to reduce the penalty if the situation warrants. Communication is key: if you are having difficulty meeting the deadline, do not hesitate to reach out; please avoid waiting until the due date to get in touch with me!
