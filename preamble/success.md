# How to succeed in this course
## <bold>Keys to success</bold>:
1. Do not fall behind. Each unit will build on concepts learned in prior ones.
2. The programs we write never work the first time (or the second, third …). It’s when things don’t work that we actually learn something. Do not wait until the last minute to start a coding assignment (or any assignment for that matter).
3. In videos where “live-coding” occurs, and in web-served content where there are code cells, TYPE IN THE CODE as you follow along. This will build your “coding muscle memory”.
4. Do not feel shy about asking questions. Even an expert started as a complete novice. Ideally, make it a point to use the online forums. But do try to seek out online resources, such as Stack Overflow and Github's Issues Trackers to work out problems on your own before immediately seeking out help.
