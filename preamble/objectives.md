# Course objectives
## By the end of the class, students will have accomplished the following:
1. Understood the need for reproducibility in scientific research and are equipped and motivated to achieve reproducibility in their ensuing research projects
2. Accessed, analyzed and visualized geoscience datasets using the Python Geoscience Software Ecosystem (PGSE)
Minimized the need to download copies of datasets from remote servers in favor of using PGSE client-access methods
3. Developed publication/presentation-ready visualizations, both static and interactive
4. Learned software-debugging strategies via the use of online resources such as StackOverflow and Github
5. Created a public repository on Github containing code, figures, and documentation of a short but data-intensive research study that could be accessed and reproduced by the community at-large
