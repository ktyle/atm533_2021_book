## Objectives

This course prepares students to learn, develop, and refine best
practices in geoscience-centric data analysis and visualzation using
free- and open-source software written in Python.

Students will develop interactive, shareable software using what is
often termed the *Python Geoscience Software Ecosystem (PGSE)*, a
continuously evolving set of Python software libraries with particular
application to atmospheric and climate science-related data access,
analysis, and visualization tasks.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the class, students will have accomplished the following:

1.  Accessed, analyzed and visualized geoscience datasets using the
    *PGSE* demonstrated in class and with online resources such as
    <https://projectpythia.org/>

2.  Minimized the need to download copies of datasets from remote
    servers in favor of using PGSE client-access methods

3.  Developed publication/presentation-ready visualizations, both static
    and interactive

4.  Learned software-debugging strategies via the use of online
    resources such as StackOverflow and Github

5.  Created a public repository on Github containing code, figures, and
    documentation of a short but data-intensive research study that
    could be accessed and reproduced by the community at-large

## Course Delivery Plan 

With the understanding that this class is intended as an asynchronous,
online-based experience, the following content methods will be used,
although each week may vary in the use of each method:

1.  Several concise pre-recorded video lectures by the instructor, often
    involving "live" coding on the department's Jupyterhub servers

2.  Interactive, self-paced tutorials, following the Project Pythia
    model (<https://pythiaproject.org/>)

3.  Jupyter notebook-served content, using the department's Jupyterhub
    servers

4.  3^rd^-party videos, such as the Metpy Monday weekly YouTube video
    series made by Unidata (
    <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQut5OXpV-0ir4IdllSt1iEZKTwFBa7kO>
    )

5.  Readings from published material, such as journal articles or
    online-accessible textbooks

## Grading and assessment

1.  4 coding assignments, focusing on the particular library or
    libraries discussed during the current and/or previous week (30 %
    total)

2.  2 coding assignments, including all libraries discussed up to the
    assignments' release (30 % total)

3.  1 group (2-3 students per group) reproducible paper final project;
    topics to be chosen by each group (25 % total)

4.  Class participation via discussion forums and surveys (15 % total)

Homework assignments will be distributed and discussed by noon Eastern
time on Mondays and will be due at noon Eastern the following Monday,
unless otherwise directed. Lateness penalties are as follows:

1.  Up to 24 hours late: 10 % penalty

2.  24-48 hours late: 20 % penalty

3.  48-120 hours late: 50 % penalty

4.  More than 120 hours late: 100 % penalty

Since assignments will typically be submitted electronically, each file
will automatically have a timestamp, to avoid any questions of the time
that the student completed the homework. The instructor reserves the
right to reduce the penalty if the situation warrants. **Communication
is key: if you are having difficulty meeting the deadline, do not
hesitate to reach out; please avoid waiting until the due date to get in
touch with me!**
