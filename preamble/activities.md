# Course activities
With the understanding that this class is intended as an asynchronous, online-based experience, the following are the intended activities, although each week may vary in the use of each method:
1. Several concise pre-recorded video lectures by the instructor, often involving “live” coding on the department’s Jupyterhub servers
2. 3rd-party videos, such as Unidata's [Metpy Monday]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQut5OXpV-0ir4IdllSt1iEZKTwFBa7kO ) weekly YouTube video series made by Unidata 
3. Interactive, self-paced tutorials, following Project Pythia ( https://projectpythia.org/ )
4. Jupyter notebook-served content, using the Jupyterhub server
5. Readings from published material, such as journal articles or online-accessible textbooks
