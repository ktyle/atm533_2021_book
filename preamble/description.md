# Course description

This course prepares students to learn, develop, and refine best practices in
geoscience-centric data analysis and visualzation using free- and open-source software
written in Python.
<br>
Students will develop interactive, shareable software using what is often termed the
Python Geoscience Software Ecosystem (PGSE), a continuously evolving set of Python
software libraries with particular application to atmospheric and climate science-related
data access, analysis, and visualization tasks.
