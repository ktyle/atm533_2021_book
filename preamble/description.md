This course prepares students to learn, develop, and refine best practices in reproducibility of research using free- and open-source software, using the Python programming language.

Students will develop interactive, shareable software using what is often termed the Python Geoscience Software Ecosystem (PGSE), a continuously evolving set of Python software libraries with particular application to atmospheric and climate science-related data access, analysis, and visualization tasks.
