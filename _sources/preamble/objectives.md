# Course objectives
## Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the class, students will have accomplished the following:
1. Accessed, analyzed and visualized geoscience datasets using the PGSE
demonstrated in class and with online resources
2. Minimized the need to download copies of datasets from remote servers in favor
of using PGSE client-access methods
3. Developed publication/presentation-ready visualizations, both static and
interactive
4. Learned software-debugging strategies via the use of online resources such as
StackOverflow and Github
5. Created a public repository on Github containing code, figures, and
documentation of a short but data-intensive research study that could be
accessed and reproduced by the community at-large
