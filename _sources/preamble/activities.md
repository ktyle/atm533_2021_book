## Course activites
With the understanding that this class is intended as an asynchronous, online-based
experience, the following content methods will be used, although each week may vary in
the use of each method:
1. Several concise pre-recorded video lectures by the instructor, often involving
“live” coding on the department’s Jupyterhub servers
2. Interactive, self-paced tutorials, following the [Project Pythia model](
https://pythiaproject.org/)
3. Jupyter notebook-served content, using the department’s Jupyterhub servers
4. 3rd -party videos, such as [Unidata's Metpy Monday weekly YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQut5OXpV0ir4IdllSt1iEZKTwFBa7kO)
5. Readings from published material, such as journal articles or online-accessible textbooks
