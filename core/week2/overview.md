# Week 2 overview: "Git" ready for Git!

## Learning Objectives:
1. Identify three possible scenarios in managing a project's digital materials:

   a. Little or no version control at all (disorganized, sporadic backups)

   b. Manual version control (e.g., make a backup copy of a document using whatever naming system(s) you feel like using that day)

   c. (Semi-)Automated version control (using a system like Git)

2. Use Git on our department's Linux servers to create, populate, and manage a sample repository of digital materials

3. Create an account on [Github.com](https://github.com)
